#BuzzPhrase Wiki

### A place to share, discuss and generally make fun of big business buzzphrases!

This wiki is designed for those who love to mock and discuss big business buzzphrases. With each passing season it seems the powers-that-be in the business world can't help themselves from coining new phrases that sound big, but actually mean nothing to anybody.

These phrases can be heard in just about any business setting, uttered mostly by nosers who
want to look smart, but have nothing valuable to contribute to the discussion. Pointy-haired bosses
love to hear them, and nod their heads in agreement at the sound of them.

This is where you get to contribute to the discussion on where these phrases might have gotten their start, where they're going, and how long it will take for the general population to realize how inane a particular gob of prattle really is.

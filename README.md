#BuzzPhrase Wiki

### A place to share, discuss and generally make fun of big business buzzphrases!

This wiki is designed for those who love big business buzzwords. It seems the pundits and powers-that-be in the business world can't help themselves from coining new phrases that sound great... and mean nothing.

These phrases can be heard in just about any corporate setting. Even worse, they get included in corporate marketing copy, both on the web and in print.

This is where you get to contribute to the discussion on where these phrases might have gotten their start, where they're going, and how long it will take for them to be forgotten in the wake of the next big buzzphrase.
